            <h2>Education Projects (so far) </h2>
            I want to use technology to make the best education in the world available to everyone. Here are some projects I've worked on so far.

            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I'm Jack Bridger and I'm writing this from Tokyo. </p>
            <p>It's a long story. But I'm here studying machine learning and web development. </p>
            <p>I applied to FAC in 2014 and you could say I've been slowly learning to code ever since.</p>
            <p>Along the way I got a masters in CS and even worked at Stack Overflow.</p>

            <h3>Why do I want to be part of FAC?</h3>
            <p>The amazing FAC Community. </p>
            <p>It's true that incredible resources are available online for free.</p>
            <p>But we also know the lone wolf programmer in her bedroom is a myth.</p> 
            <p>To make change we need friends and colleagues who believe in the same ideals.</p>

                    <button id="nextslider" onclick="nextImg()">Next</button>
                </div>


            <h3>What can I bring to FAC?</h3>
            <p>I believe so strongly in programming education and I will do whatever I can to help others when they are struggling.</p>
            <p>I fell at those hurdles for longer than most.</p>
            <p>With the cohort I will happily share everything I've learned running startups and working in sales. </p>
            <p><b>Most importantly I hope I can bring friendship and passion for making change using all types of technology (including Machine Learning! ü§ñ)</b> </p>
            <p>P.s. actually maybe I'll be most useful for sourcing Stack Overflow laptop stickers!</p>
