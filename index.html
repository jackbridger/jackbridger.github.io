                <h1>Why FAC? Why me?</h1>
                <h2>I first applied to FAC 4 years ago. Since then I've been on a varied journey in the world of <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/computing-science/">Computer Science</a>, <a href="codeatuni.com">startups</a> and even working at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. I hope to contribute to the curiousity, kindness and entrepreneurial spirit of the FAC community. </h3>

                <p>Education has enabled me to do so many things I never thought possible growing up.</p>

                <p>And since <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/careers/2016/10/12/meet-the-code-at-uni-team-lse-alum-delivering-world-class-programming-education/">Code at Uni gradually snowballed from one-off event to standalone business over the course of five years</a> education has captured my imagination.</p>

                <p>This year I have been <a href="https://medium.com/@jacksbridger/from-sales-to-machine-learning-in-64-days-plus-way-way-more-3c2369d8a8fe">self studying Data Science</a> through every resource available.</p>

                <p>It's been incredible to study the best resources in the world for free.</p>

                <p>But, I really miss working with smart, conscientious people.</p>

                <p>I understand Dan Sofer had a <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-run-free-peer-led-coding-bootcamps-an-interview-with-dan-sofer-3e0a82ed45e"> similar experience with online education</a>.</p>

                <p>This, plus the fact every FAC alum I've met has been awesome is why I am now focusing on applying to Founders and Coders.</p>

                <p>Because I would love the opportunity to learn and work with like-minded people who care about technology and more importantly care about what technology can enable.</p>

                <p>I'm also excited to help others beyond the program.</p>

                <p>Great community combined with free online knowledge is something the world needs more of. I hope to be part of one and I hope to help create one in the future. </p>
