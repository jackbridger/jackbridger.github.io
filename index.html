            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I'm Jack Bridger and I'm writing this from Tokyo. </p>
            <p>I've been here for almost 6 months studying machine learning and web development. </p>
            <p>There's a long story to how this happened.</p>
            <p>I applied to FAC in 2014 and you could say I've been slowly learning to code ever since. </p>
            <p>I've run Code at Uni for 5 years, got a masters in CS and even worked at Stack Overflow.</p>

            <h3>Why do I want to be part of FAC?</h3>
            <p>Community. </p>
            <p>The best resources are available online for free. We can teach ourselves anything in the world from anywhere.</p>
            <p>But we all know the lone wolf programmer in her bedroom is a myth.</p> <p>To make change we need friends and colleagues who believe in the same ideals.</p>
            <p>Everyone I've met from FAC has been incredible!</p>

                    <button id="nextslider" onclick="nextImg()">Next</button>
                </div>


            <h3>What can I bring to FAC?</h3>
            <p>I believe so strongly in programming education and I will do whatever I can to help others when they are struggling.</p>
            <p>I fell at those hurdles for longer than most.</p>
            <p>With the cohort I will happily share everything I've learned running startups and working in sales. </p>
            <p>Mostly I hope I can bring friendship and passion for making change using all types of technology (including Machine Learning!) </p>
