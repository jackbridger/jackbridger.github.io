            <h3>Who is Jack Bridger?</h3>
            <p>
                I first applied to FAC 4 years ago. Since then I've been on a... pretty varied journey in the world of Computer Science, startups and even working at Stack Overflow.
                Education has enabled me to do so many things I never thought possible growing up.

                And since Code at Uni gradually snowballed from one-off event to standalone business over the course of five years education has captured my imagination.

                This year I have been self studying Machine Learning through every resource available, from the busy streets of Tokyo.

            <h3>Why do I want to be part of FAC?</h3>
            <p>It's been incredible to study the best resources in the world for free.

                But, I really missed working every day with smart, conscientious people.

                I understand Dan Sofer had a similar experience with online education.

                This, plus the fact every FAC alum I've met has been awesome is why I am now focusing on applying to Founders and Coders.

                Because I would love the opportunity to learn and work with like-minded people who care about technology and more importantly care about what technology can enable.

                    <button id="nextslider" onclick="nextImg()">Next</button>
                </div>


            <h3>What can I bring to FAC?</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to my (future) programming skills, I would love to share my experiences starting a business. Especially things like basic sales practices which help enormously in getting things you care about off the ground.

                In the long run, I think applied education (e.g. coding) is still mostly only available at an expensive price. Free information is not enough for most people to learn effectively. I agree with the ethos of FAC - Peer to peer learning while leveraging the internet's treasure trove of free information is a huge part of the solution. I hope to help further this vision.
